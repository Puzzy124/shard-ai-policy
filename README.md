# Privacy Commitment at Shard AI

At Shard AI, we prioritize your privacy and are committed to ensuring a secure and transparent experience for our users. Here's our approach to data collection:

## Data Collection Practices

We want to assure you that we do not store, sell, use, or exploit your personal data for any purpose. Our focus is on providing a seamless user experience without compromising your privacy.

### What Data is Collected?

Shard AI strictly collects and utilizes only essential information, namely message content and channel IDs. This data is crucial for the proper functioning of Shard's features, especially those that require channel-specific settings, such as the chat bot.

### Why Do We Collect This Data?

The collection of message content and channel IDs is solely for the purpose of enabling specific features within Shard AI. For instance, certain commands and functionalities rely on channel-specific settings. Knowing the channel ID allows Shard to deliver a tailored experience to users based on their preferences.

## Data Deletion Process

We understand the importance of providing users with control over their data. Deleting your data from Shard AI is a straightforward process.

### How Can You Delete Your Data?

You have two simple options to delete your data:

1. **Remove Shard from Your Server:** If you wish to discontinue using Shard AI and delete your data, simply remove Shard from your server.

2. **Toggle Command:** Alternatively, you can run the toggle command again. This action will refresh and update your settings, ensuring that your data is no longer stored by Shard AI.
